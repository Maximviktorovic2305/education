# TanStack Query Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the frontend application from Zustand-based state management to TanStack Query for server state management, while keeping Zustand for UI-only state.

## Key Changes

### 1. Package Installation
- Added `@tanstack/react-query` and `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`

### 2. Core Infrastructure
- Created `src/lib/queryClient.ts` - TanStack Query client configuration with retry logic and error handling
- Created `src/providers/QueryProvider.tsx` - Provider wrapper with React Query DevTools
- Created `src/lib/queryKeys.ts` - Centralized query keys factory for organized cache management

### 3. Query Hooks
Created comprehensive query hooks for all domains:
- `useAuth.ts` - Authentication hooks (login, register, profile, logout)
- `useCourses.ts` - Course management hooks
- `useProblems.ts` - Problem submission and code execution hooks
- `useTests.ts` - Test management and session hooks
- `useProgress.ts` - Progress tracking hooks
- `useCertificates.ts` - Certificate management hooks
- `usePlatform.ts` - Platform features and levels hooks

### 4. Store Refactoring
Deleted server state stores and kept only UI state stores:
- **Deleted** (server state): auth, certificate, course, platform, problem, progress, test, userStats
- **Kept** (UI state): navigation, editor, notifications, theme, uiPreferences

### 5. Component Updates
Updated all components to use TanStack Query hooks instead of Zustand stores:
- WelcomeSection, DashboardHeader - Profile data
- CourseSidebar - Course and section data
- FeaturesSection, LevelsSection - Platform data
- AuthGuard, GuestGuard - Authentication state
- All pages and components using server data

### 6. API Integration
- Removed all mock data from API files
- Replaced with real API calls to backend endpoints
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Improved Performance
- Automatic caching and background updates
- Reduced unnecessary API calls
- Better loading states and user experience

### 2. Better Developer Experience
- Organized query keys for easy cache management
- Built-in DevTools for debugging
- Consistent data fetching patterns

### 3. Enhanced Reliability
- Automatic retry logic
- Error handling with user feedback
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### 4. Clean Architecture
- Clear separation between server state (TanStack Query) and UI state (Zustand)
- Centralized data fetching logic
- Reduced component complexity

## Migration Status
âœ… **Complete** - All components updated, build successful, no module import errors

## Remaining Lint Issues
These are non-critical warnings that don't affect functionality:
- Unused variable warnings
- "any" type warnings (should be addressed for better type safety)

## Next Steps
1. Address remaining "any" type warnings for better type safety
2. Implement more specific error handling based on error types
3. Add more advanced caching strategies for specific use cases
4. Consider implementing query invalidation for real-time updates
